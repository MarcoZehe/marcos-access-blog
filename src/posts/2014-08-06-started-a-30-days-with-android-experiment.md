After I revisited the results of my Switching to Android experiment, and finding most (like 99.5%) items in order now, I decided on Tuesday to conduct a serious 30 days with Android endeavor. I have handed in my iPhone to my wife, and she&#8217;s keeping (confiscating) it for me.

I will also keep a diary of experiences. However, since that is very specific and not strictly Mozilla-related, and since this blog is syndicated on Planet Mozilla, I have decided to create a [new blog](http://marcozehe.com/30dayswithandroid/) especially for that occasion. You&#8217;re welcome to follow along there if you&#8217;d like, and do feel free to comment[Update August 30, 2014]: The experiment was over after 18 of the 30 days, so the blog linked to above is the archive I am keeping on my new site. The Blogger links that were here previously will disappear, and I encourage to visit the new blog and spread the word!

Also, if you follow [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarcoInEnglish), the hashtag #30DaysWithAndroid will be used to denote things around this topic, and announce the new posts as I write them, hopefully every day.

It&#8217;s exciting, and I still feel totally crazy about it! ðŸ™‚ Well, here goes!

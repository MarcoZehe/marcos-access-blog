Hi and welcome to my blog!

My goal is to blog about everything and anything I deem important in the world of accessible software (or such that strives to become such). I&#8217;ll be talking about my work for Mozilla Corp. that starts on December 3rd, as well as other ideas, software and basically anything I or my readers might find interesting.

Please bear with me as I get all these WordPress defaults revamped, especially the blog roll.

Enjoy the read, and please feel free to subscribe to my RSS feed at the bottom of the page!

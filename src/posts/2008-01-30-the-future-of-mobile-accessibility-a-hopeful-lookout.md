In case you haven&#8217;t read it yet: [Nokia acquires Trolltech](http://dougt.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/nokia-acquires-trolltech/). DougT also posted a follow-up article on the future, or lack thereof, of Symbian S60/S40, which you can find [here](http://dougt.wordpress.com/2008/01/29/death-to-s60s40/).

For accessibility, this currently provokes mixed feelings. On the one side, the S60 platform has been a very successful accessibility story, with [Talks](http://www.nuance.com/talks/) and [Mobile Speak](http://codefactory.es/en/products.asp?id=24) being the most prominent representatives of access to this platform. Blind and low-vision users have come to depend on accessibility to their mobile phone&#8217;s contacts, short messages, MP3 capabilities or even navigational aids. To a much lesser extent, this is also true for Windows Mobile-based smartphones, but like in the world of general customers, this has taken off much less than Symbian has.

On the other hand, this move to an open-source embedded solution for future generations of Nokia phones may become an even greater accessibility success story. With the Gnome Accessibility proceedings on a very good way to wide-spread adoption, KDE needs to follow, or they&#8217;ll fall by the wayside with government organizations sooner or later. While KDE&#8217;s accessibility efforts are, compared to Gnome, still in a rather limited state of development, QT has made some significant progress in that it has become accessible on Windows recently by using Microsoft&#8217;s Active Accessibility.

It is my hope that not only can Gnome and KDE agree on sharing a unified interface for AT vendors, as expressed in [this early posting](https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/accessibility/2005-February/001098.html) on AT-SPI, but that IAccessible2 and Mac Universal access will also join forces in an effort to provide compelling access to a wide range of technologies. With this in place, this could also be carried over to a wide range of embedded solutions, providing a solid accessibility architecture on which screen readers and other assistive technologies can be built. In addition, this would make it a lot easier for software developers to ensure the accessibility of their applications.

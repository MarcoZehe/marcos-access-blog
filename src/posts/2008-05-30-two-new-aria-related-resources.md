There are two new ARIA resources that recently entered the web which I&#8217;d like to point you to if you&#8217;re interested:

Paciello Group have started an [ARIA tutorial](http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?p=68).

Peter Thiessen of ATRC in Toronto, Canada, has started a [blog on Live Regions](http://blog.overscore.com/).

Cool stuff, guys!

A friend of mine published his very first blog post on Monday. Congratulations, Schepp, and welcome to the world of blogging! His post is not related to web accessibility, but I found it a fascinating read, so am sharing it with you. He [describes how he wrangled ads](https://schepp.dev/posts/ad-integration-in-2020/) into the responsive (and accessible) relaunch of the media company&#8217;s web site he is working on. But be warned, it&#8217;s not for the faint of heart, and very technical. And fascinating. ðŸ™‚

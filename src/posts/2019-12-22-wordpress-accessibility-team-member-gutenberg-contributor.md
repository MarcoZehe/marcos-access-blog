My [recent](https://marcozehe.de/2019/11/27/my-thoughts-on-gutenberg-accessibility/)[frequent](https://marcozehe.de/2019/12/13/a-quick-introduction-to-using-gutenberg/)[blogging](https://marcozehe.de/2019/12/18/a-few-quick-tips-on-gutenberg-on-mobile-devices/) about Gutenberg has led to some really productive changes.

One change is that my [profile on WordPress.org](https://profiles.wordpress.org/marcoz/) now shows that I am also contributing to the [accessibility effort](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/). The accessibility team mostly consists of volunteers. And now, I am one of them as well.

I also started contributing [more than issues](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/pull/19261)[to Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/19233). I can also review and label issues and pull requests now. There are some exciting changes ahead that I helped test and review in the past few days, and I promise I&#8217;ll blog about them once they are in an official plugin release.

It is my hope that my contributions will help bring the accessibility forward in a good direction for all. I&#8217;d like to thank both the other members of the WordPress accessibility team as well as the maintainers of Gutenberg for welcoming me to the community.

Last night, I received an e-mail from Jimmy Atkinson, owner of the Web Hosting Database, who informed me that this blog is now listed in the [100 killer web accessibility resources, blogs, forums and tutorials](http://whdb.com/2008/100-killer-web-accessibility-resources-blogs-forums-and-tutorials/) article. I must admit I&#8217;m totally blown away by this, and would just like to whole-heartedly thank Jimmy for this recognition!

I highly recommend you check out this resource, it&#8217;s a great list of places to look for accessibility information on the web! And I feel extremely honored to be listed among tose great sites! Thanks again!

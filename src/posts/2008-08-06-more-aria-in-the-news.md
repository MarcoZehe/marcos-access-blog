As I&#8217;m catching up with news after my return from Whistler, I have two suggested ARIA-related readings for you:

[Gez Lemon](http://dev.opera.com/author/1710830) of the Opera Developer community has posted an article titled [Introduction to WAI ARIA](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/introduction-to-wai-aria/). This is probably the most comprehensive, but easy to understand, introduction to WAI ARIA I&#8217;ve come across so far! Thanks Gez!

Victor Tsaran from Yahoo! has posted an article on the YUI blog titled [Enhancing TabView Accessibility with WAI-ARIA Roles and States](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/07/30/tabview-aria/). It is a hands-on example that shows a lot of techniques outlined by Gez in action. There are both the final example to try out, and a screen cast to watch. Thanks Victor!

Happy reading!

Have you heard of Blue Beanie Day before? Well, I have, but only because I have been involved with web standards and accessibility for so long. The [Cute Calendar has all information](https://www.cute-calendar.com/event/blue-beanie-day/35785.html).

And you know what? I even know a few people who celebrate it. This year, I&#8217;ve heard of [Deborah](https://www.lireo.com/web-standards-blue-beanie-day-returns/) and [Jeffrey](https://twitter.com/zeldman/status/1199694645795676162) celebrating it. Do you celebrate it, too? Let us all know in the comments! ðŸ˜‰

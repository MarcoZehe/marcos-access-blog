[Jim Zemlin](http://www.linux-foundation.org/weblogs/jzemlin/) of the Linux foundation wrote a very good [post on this year being the year of the Linux desktop breakthrough](http://www.linux-foundation.org/weblogs/jzemlin/2008/08/26/this-is-the-year-of-the-linux-desktop-breakout/). One thing he did only mention marginally, but which I think is just as important for certain users/markets, is the fact that there is now a wide range of accessibility solutions available for at least the GNOME desktop, which either come directly with the distribution such as [the Orca screen reader for the visually impaired](http://live.gnome.org/Orca), or are easily installable. Screen reading, which includes support for a huge variety of braille displays, magnification, on-screen keyboard solutions, alternative input device support are all available as open-source now and open up the Linux desktop alternative to virtually every potential user.

And there&#8217;s more when it comes to the mobile platform. The Mozilla Foundation funded a feasibility study last year to migrate the communication layer for the assistive technology service provider interface (AT-SPI) from using Corba to using DBus, which is a key part in getting screen reading support on the mobile Linux platform. Nokia is now funding the actual migration work. I&#8217;ll blog more about the mobile prospective from an accessibility standpoint in the near future.

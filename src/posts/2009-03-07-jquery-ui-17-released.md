The jQuery UI team has [released jQuery UI 1.7](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2009/03/jquery-ui-17/). Congrats on this release!

One thing the team did not mention in the above blog post is the fact that jQuery UI 1.7 is the first version to contain WAI-ARIA enhancements, making the widgets more, or at all, accessible. WOOT!

It&#8217;s really cool to see another big player in the JS widgets field to adopt WAI-ARIA, making modern websites more accessible the moment they just switch to this version of jQuery UI.
